# [JSL04] Submission: Monster Ternary Operator

## Project Overview
In this project we were to implement ternary operators based on the instructions provided. Successful completion of the project will depend on our abiliy to follow the instructions for the ternary operators.

## Challenges Faced
While I initially felt unfamiliar with the ternary operators, I am leaving this project confident in my abilities to implement ternaries within my code from here on out. The challenges within the project provided effective practice at writing ternaries and I am happy with my submission

## Final Thoughts
I am confident in my abilities with ternaries from here onwards and I am looking forward to the next challenge. This weeks content on the LMS was enjoyable, and incredibly interesting. We had a lot of theory to cover, however I feel I have a firm grip on ternaries going forward, as well as the other content covered such as switch statements, control flow diagrams, and procedural operators.
